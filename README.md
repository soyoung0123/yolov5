# Topic: Use Yolov5 to distinguish between ripe and undercooked tomatoes

My parents run a tomato farm, and distinguishing between ripe and unripe tomatoes during harvest has always been a time-consuming and costly task. Recently, I learned about a deep learning technology called YOLOv5, and I thought it would be great to apply this technology to the farm to automate the process of identifying ripe and unripe tomatoes. After training the model, I was able to develop a system that accurately distinguishes between ripe and unripe tomatoes. This has significantly reduced labor costs and saved a lot of time. Moving forward, I hope to use this technology to contribute to advancements in agriculture in even more ways.
